A python3 package which implements different sampling algorithms, including the chebyshev accelerated gibbs sampler

# Installation:
TODO: make package available via pip.
</br>
For now, simply clone this package into the directory in which you store python packages on your local machine.
In Python 2.7 and up, this can be found by executing the following command in a python shell:
```python
>>> import site; site.getsitepackages()
['/usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages', '/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages', '/usr/lib/python3.6/dist-packages']
```
One can then change to this directory in the terminal. I choose to use the local folder, so I am only installing the package for myself and not the other users on my computer:
```bash
cd /usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages
```
We can then clone the repository
```bash
sudo git clone https://github.com/bencravens/fastgibbs
```
And the package should be installed.
